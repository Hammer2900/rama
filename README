rama - yet another tiling window manager
----------------------------------------

rama is a window manager that aims to provide some features to manage
tasks/workflows. It also tiles your windows.

rama is written in pure python, and uses the xpyb library to talk to
X. Currently, it is not very useful, and major design changes are
bound to occur.

See `notes.org' for an explanation of some of the design ideas I have
for rama. Keep in mind that these notes are quite old, and some
proposals (such as the use of D-BUS for IPC) will likely be
reconsidered.


Dependencies
------------

Required:
python (tested on 2.6)
xpyb

Optional:
Xephyr (for testing)


Testing
-------

See `test-rama.sh' for a simple script that launches rama in a Xephyr
instance. You can use the keybindings to launch programs, or prepend
`DISPLAY=:1' to a shell command.

Edit `rama.py' to configure rama.

  response to various X events.
